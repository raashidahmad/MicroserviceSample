# MicroserviceSample
This is a sample project which i have created to understand the basics of Microservices using ASP.NET Core 3.1. The project contains two services
and an API Gateway. The project is not doing any special but instead aimed to create a POC.

# Technologies Used
- C#.NET
- ASP.NET WEB API Core 3.1
- Ocelot (Open source API Gateway)

# How to run the project
The project is being developed using Microsoft Visual Studio 2019. The project contains three separate projects.

- MicroserviceSample.Orders (A service)
- MicroserviceSample.Currencies (A service)
- MicroserviceSample.APIGateway (Gateway for the services, created using Ocelot)

Open the solution using Visual Studio and run it. Before running the projects, right click on the main project and set the all the three projects to
start simultaneously.
